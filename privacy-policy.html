        <p class="mb-4">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
            Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard
            for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
            browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
            If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
            that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT
            signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT
            signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-2 mt-6 font-bold">Request Verification</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the
                same person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal information
                provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot
                verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
                additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
                purposes.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional
                information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a
                written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.</p>
