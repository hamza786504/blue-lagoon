    <p class=" mb-4">
        The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person
        or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
        regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
        Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
        initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are
        applicable.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
        Industry-specific compliance for a blue lagoon involves adhering to various regulations and standards to
        ensure user safety, data privacy, and ethical practices. Key areas of compliance include:
    </p>
    <p>
        Data Privacy: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR (General Data
        Protection Regulation) in the European Union and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the United
        States. This includes obtaining clear consent for data collection, providing data privacy policies, and
        ensuring secure storage and handling of personal data.
        <br>
        User Safety: Implementing measures to protect users from harassment, fraud, and other harmful
        behaviors. This may involve moderating content, monitoring user interactions, and having mechanisms for
        reporting and addressing any incidents of safety violations and misconduct.
        <br>
        Legal Compliance: Adhering to relevant local, national, and international laws, which may include
        implementing
        industry-specific regulations and standards.
        <br>
        Advertising Standards: Complying with advertising regulations to ensure that advertisements are
        transparent and not misleading and adhering to relevant advertising standards and guidelines.
        <br>
        Content Moderation: Enforcing content moderation policies to prevent the sharing of explicit, offensive, or
        illegal content. This involves having clear community guidelines and employing moderation teams or automated
        systems to review and manage user-generated content.
        <br>
        Moderation and Enforcement: Having robust systems for moderating content and managing moderation teams or
        algorithms. This includes following industry best practices for content moderation to prevent the spread of

        these
        Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a
        "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
        those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
        Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

    <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>
    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to these Legal Terms shall be
        determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the
        European Court of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg,
        and which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this
        clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be Bonn, Germany. The language of the proceedings
        shall be English, German. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of Germany.</p>

    <strong>Restrictions</strong>
    <p class="mt-5 mb-5">The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
        individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;
        (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class
        action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

    <strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</strong>
    <p class="mt-5">The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
        informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
        validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
        allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
        Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
        Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
